SUCCESS: All processes successfully completed!

Now - increase the task duration (representing 
      the time the task has the database 
      tied up during an insert statement).
How well do multiple, concurrent processes share a database 
    when each task takes more time? 
How can multiple processes share a resource
    without interfering with each other?
